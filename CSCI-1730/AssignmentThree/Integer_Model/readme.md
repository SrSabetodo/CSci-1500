Write a class `IntSet` for modeling sets of integers in the range 0 through 99. A set should be represented internally as an array of type `bool`: The ith array element will be `true` whenever integer `i` is in the set and will be `false` whenever integer `i` is not in the set. Include a no-argument constructor that initializes a set to the so-called “empty set,” i.e., a set whose array representation contains all false values. The class should include the following overloaded operators:

- `+` to perform the union of two sets (the union of sets A and B is the set that contains all elements of set A or set B, or both).
	
- `*` to perform the intersection of two sets (the intersection of sets A and B is the set that contains all elements in both set A and set B.)
	
- `-` to form the difference of two sets (the difference of sets A and B is the set containing those elements that are in A but not in B)

- `+=` to add an integer into a set.

- `-=` to delete an integer from a set.

- `==` to determine if two sets are equal. 

- `!` to form the complement of a set (the complement of set A, denoted A-bar, is the set containing all the elements in the universal set that are not in A - the universal set for this problem is the set containing all integers between 0 and 99)

- `<=` to determine if one set is a subset of another set (set A is a subset of set B means that for any element x in A, x is also an element of set B).

- `<<` to display a set in roster notation (for example, {2, 3, 5, 9})

Requirement: The overloaded `+=` and `-=` operators should check for valid integer input (in the range 0-99), or if an add-item is already in the set, or if a delete-item is not in the set. An error message for invalid input should be generated.

Then, write a C++ program that uses the new `IntSet` class. The program should allow the user to repeatedly select from these options:

•	add numbers to a set

•	remove numbers from a set

•	form the union of two sets

•	form the intersection of two sets

•	form the difference of two sets

•	determine if two sets are equal

•	form the complement of an set

•	determine if one set is a subset of another set

•	display a set

The program should allow for up to ten sets to be created during a given program run. Use any stand-alone functions you feel necessary.

Here is output from a sample run of the program (user input in bold):
